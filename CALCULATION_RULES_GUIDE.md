## Integration with FR 2052a Validation

### How Rules Are Used

When you execute validations on the **FR 2052a Validation** screen:

1. FR 2052a data rows are generated
2. Each row is assigned a `product_id`
3. Components (HQLA, Outflows, Inflows) are created
4. Each component references a `rule_code` from the Calculation Rules
5. **View Rule** button shows the full rule details
6. **View Records** button shows the FR 2052a source data used in the calculation

### Rule Code Linkage

Every component in the validation screen has a `rule_code` that links to these calculation rules:

**Example Flow:**
1. HQLA Component: "U.S. Treasury Securities"
2. Component has `rule_code = 'HQLA_L1_SOVEREIGN'`
3. Click "View Rule" → Opens modal showing full rule details from Calculation Rules
4. Click "View Records" → Shows FR 2052a line items used in this calculation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why are there multiple HQLA levels?

**A:** The Basel III framework creates tiers of liquid assets based on quality and liquidity characteristics:
- **Level 1**: Highest quality, no haircut (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasuries)
- **Level 2A**: High quality, 15% haircut, capped at 40%
- **Level 2B**: Lower quality, 50% haircut, capped at 15%

This tiering ensures banks hold the most liquid assets while providing flexibility.

### Q: How is the LCR calculated?

**A:**
```
LCR = Total HQLA / Total Net Cash Outflows (over 30 days)
```

- **Minimum Requirement:** 100%
- **HQLA:** Sum of Level 1 + Level 2A (with cap) + Level 2B (with cap)
- **Net Cash Outflows:** Total Outflows - MIN(Total Inflows, 75% × Total Outflows)

### Q: What is the 75% inflow cap?

**A:** The inflow cap limits total recognized inflows to 75% of total outflows. This ensures banks maintain at least 25% of their liquidity needs from high-quality assets rather than relying on expected inflows, which may not materialize in stress.

### Q: How often are these rules updated?

**A:** Calculation rules are based on federal regulations (12 CFR 249) and change only when regulations are updated. The Federal Reserve publishes amendments through the Federal Register. Major changes typically have implementation periods of 6-12 months.

### Q: Can I export the rules?

**A:** Currently, rules are view-only within the application. For official regulatory text, refer to:
- FR 2052a Instructions: [federalreserve.gov/reportforms](https://www.federalreserve.gov/reportforms.htm)
